# Plain Matlab NI-DAQmx examples

The idea: This project will provide and extend the examples of using Matlab with a National Instruments (NI) DAQ card _without_ the Data Acquisition Toolbox, with the code by Jens Roesner and Nathan Tomlin.

In addition, the code's (public) history will be logged with this Git repo, and the license terms will be clarified.

## Current status

So far, this project contains the files and descriptions downloaded from <https://www.jensroesner.com/work/matlab/index.html>.
(The zip files `NIconstants.zip` and `NI_2_Matlab.zip` were extracted in the root folder.)

### Authors

- Jens Roesner
- Johannes Keyser (so far, only editorial work)

### License

Jens Roesner retro-actively licenses his code under GPL, see folder [LICENSES](LICENSES).
Jens Roesner's choice was established via personal communication with Johannes Keyser.

TODO: To clarify the licensing, the repository will be [REUSE compliant](https://reuse.software/).
