# Plain Matlab NI-DAQmx examples

The idea: This project will provide and extend the examples of using Matlab with a National Instruments (NI) DAQ card _without_ the Data Acquisition Toolbox, with the code by Jens Roesner and Nathan Tomlin.

In addition, the code's (public) history will be logged with this Git repo, and the license terms will be clarified.

## Current status

So far, this project contains a dump of the files and descriptions by Jens Roesner and Nathan Tomlin.
See [Description_Jens_Roesner.md](Description_Jens_Roesner.md) and [Description_Nathan_Tomlin.md](Description_Nathan_Tomlin.md) for their descriptions.

The next step is to remove redundant/outdated code and improve the documentation.

### Authors
